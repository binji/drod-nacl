//Util2_0.h
//Declarations for CUtil2_0.

//2.0 is unimplemented.  To work with 2.0 data, you would need to get a version of drodutil 
//from CVS that correspondeds to the 2.0 format that was distributed.  I've removed the 
//implementation to avoid confusion.  Also, long-term I would like to late-bind these CUtil-derived 
//objects to compatibility DLLs.
