//Util1_6.h
//Declarations for CUtil1_6.

//1.6 is unimplemented.  To work with 1.6 data, you would need to get a version of drodutil 
//from CVS that corresponded to the 1.6 format that was distributed.  I've removed the 
//implementation to avoid confusion.  Also, long-term I would like to late-bind these CUtil-derived 
//objects to compatibility DLLs.
