//Util1_5.h
//Declarations for CUtil1_5.

//1.5 is unimplemented.  To work with 1.5 data, you would need to get a version of drodutil 
//from CVS that corresponded to the 1.5 format that was distributed.  I've removed the 
//implementation to avoid confusion.  Also, long-term I would like to late-bind these CUtil-derived 
//objects to compatibility DLLs.
