Compiling DROD:TCB from scratch on Windows XP
1 September 2008
by silver Harloe

This is a diary of what silver did to make compile DROD:TCB from scratch on Windows XP.
No guarantees, warantees, or promises of help come with.

(see http://forum.caravelgames.com/viewtopic.php?TopicID=15611&page=0#258890)

--------------------------------

1.  http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/downloads/default.aspx
    Under "step 2," I selected "Go!" under "visual c++".
    This downloaded vcsetup.exe - I just put it on my desktop, I assume whereever is fine
2.  I ran vcsetup.exe. I personally chose not to send my setup experience to MS,
    and did not check options for MSDN express or the SQL Server thing. I assume that
    checking these or not is unimportant for DROD.
3.  After install it brought up a box with two links: one to get updates, one to register.
    I selected register, which brought up a webpage. Since I do not already have a
    "Windows Live" ID, I signed up for one. It was nice enough to remember I was trying
    to register VC++ after signing up, and so I registered on the next page.
    It sent me three emails, 2 of which yahoo marked as "bulk". I confirmed my email
    address with the link from the second email, and finished my registration with
    the link from the third email. I was sent a 14 character registration code.
    The Windows Update link is just the generic OS upgrade and not VS specific, so
    I ignored it and closed the (finished) installer.
4.  Back on http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/downloads/default.aspx
    Under "step 3", I selected "Download Visual C++ 2005 Express SP1" (since I'm not using Vista,
    I ignored the Vista related section below). This downloaded VS80sp1-KB926748-X86-INTL.exe,
    again I just put it on my desktop and ran it. ("ok," "i agree," (wait), "ok.")
5.  From the Start Menu, I navigated to and ran Visual C++ 2005 Express Edition. Once it was
    done with first time stuff, I went to "Help" and selected "Register Product" and entered
    the code from step 3.
    My code was invalid (possibly because I took too long to get here after step 3), so I
    selected "register now" and this time did have a Windows Live ID, so I logged in and it
    gave me a new key, which worked.
    I selected "no" to the anonymous survey, but I assume this is moot.

Okay, now I have VC++ Express installed and registered, but I will be wanting to make
standalone executables, so I need to do some more installation...

6.  _using Internet Explorer_, I went to
    http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/visualc/usingpsdk/
    Under "step 2," I selected "Platform SDK"
    On the next page, since I have genuine Windows, I hit the "Continue" button,
    and on the next page I hit the "Download" button next to "PSDK-x86.exe".
    I went ahead and downloaded to my desktop.
7.  I ran PSDK-x86.exe... wait for installer to work,
        next, I agree, next, typical, next, next, next...
    then I read a few dozen pages of the top novel on my stack of books...
    after a long long time, this installed it to the default path of
    "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Platform SDK for Windows Server 2003 R2".
8.  In my favorite text editor, I opened up the file
    "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 8\VC\vcpackages\VCProjectEngine.Dll.Express.Config"
    I edited the Inlude="" line by adding this inside the quotes, at the end:
        ;C:\Program Files\Microsoft Platform SDK for Windows Server 2003 R2\Include;C:\Program Files\Microsoft Platform SDK for Windows Server 2003 R2\Include\mfc
    I edited the Library="" line similarly, adding:
        ;C:\Program Files\Microsoft Platform SDK for Windows Server 2003 R2\Lib
    And the Path="" line:
        ;C:\Program Files\Microsoft Platform SDK for Windows Server 2003 R2\Bin
    Saved the file and exited.
9.  I opened up a command prompt window and typed:
        cd "%USERPROFILE%\Local Settings\Application Data\Microsoft\VCExpress\8.0"
    then did a "dir". Had the file "vccomponents.dat" existed, I would have removed it.
10. Back to my favorite editor, I opened up the file
    "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 8\VC\VCProjectDefaults;corewin_express.vsprops"
    I edited the AdditionalDependencies line from:
        AdditionalDependencies="kernel32.lib"
    to:
        AdditionalDependencies="kernel32.lib user32.lib gdi32.lib winspool.lib comdlg32.lib advapi32.lib shell32.lib ole32.lib oleaut32.lib uuid.lib"
    Saved the file and then...
11. Opened up the file
    "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 8\VC\VCWizards\AppWiz\Generic\Application\html\1033\AppSettings.htm"
    I searched for "WIN_APP.disabled" and changed it from "true" to "false". Right below it, I also set to false.
    "WIN_APP_LABEL.disabled", "DLL_APP.disabled", "DLL_APP_LABEL.disabled".
    Saved the file and exited.

In theory I can now compile standalone executable windows apps. On to the DROD Specific stuff.

12. http://forum.caravelgames.com/viewsitepage.php?id=98165
    Downloaded the 3.x source to my desktop (today it was 3.2.1.84),
    and unzipped it a folder I made there, so I have a Desktop\drod\DROD32Source folder
13. I opened up Desktop\drod\DROD32Source\Master\Master.sln _in my favorite text editor_ (not yet in VC++)
    and edited line 22, wherein it says "..\..\BackEndLib\BackEndLib.vcproj" to just "..\BackEndLib\BackEndLib.vcproj"
    and edited line 24, making the same edit (remove ..\) for FrontEndLib
    then removed lines 16-21 (the CaravelNet Project, since source for that was not included)
    Saved the file and exited.

Let's start getting third party software...

14. I made the directory Desktop\drod\ThirdParty
15. downloaded http://curl.haxx.se/download/libcurl-7.15.2-win32-msvc.zip to that folder
    and extraced to Desktop\drod\ThirdParty\libcurl-7.15.2-win32-msvc
16. http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=10127&package_id=11277
    selected "expat_win32bin_2_0_1.exe"
    downloaded to Desktop\drod\ThirdParty
    ran it, but changed the extract path to Desktop\drod\ThirdParty\Expat-2.0.0
17. downloaded http://www.fmod.org/index.php/release/version/fmodapi375win.zip
    and extracted to Desktop\drod\ThirdParty\fmodapi375win
18. http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=5624&package_id=5683
    had to scroll down and click on 1.2.25 to find the version used in drod, but found a link to
    lpng1225.zip
    extracted it to Desktop\drod\ThirdParty\lpng1225
19. downloaded ftp://ftp.simtel.net/pub/simtelnet/msdos/graphics/jpegsr6.zip
    and extracted to Desktop\drod\ThirdParty\jpeg-6b
20. downloaded http://downloads.xiph.org/releases/theora/libtheora-1.0beta2.zip
    and extracted to Desktop\drod\ThirdParty\libtheora-1.0beta2
21. downloaded http://www.equi4.com/pub/mk/metakit-2.4.9.7.tar.gz
    and extracted to Desktop\drod\ThirdParty\metakit-2.4.9.7
    (I had previously downloaded/installed gzip and tar binaries for windows)
22. downloaded http://www.libsdl.org/release/SDL-devel-1.2.12-VC6.zip
    and extracted to Desktop\drod\SDL-1.2.12
23. downloaded http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/release/SDL_ttf-devel-2.0.8-VC6.zip
    and extracted to Desktop\drod\ThirdParty\SDL_ttf-2.0.8
24. http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=3157&package_id=3121
    had to scroll down and click on 1.2.25 to find the version used in drod, but found a link to
    ft214.zip
    extracted it to Desktop\drod\ThirdParty\freetype-2.1.4
25. downloaded http://www.zlib.net/zlib123.zip
    extracted it to Desktop\drop\zlib (slight pain here: they didn't include the top-level
    directory in the zip file, so I had to make the directory and extract all the zip contents
    to that to prevent polluting ThirdParty)
26. http://downloads.xiph.org/releases/ogg/libogg-1.1.3.zip
    and extracted to Desktop\drod\ThirdParty\libogg-1.1.3
27. http://downloads.xiph.org/releases/vorbis/libvorbis-1.2.0.zip
    and extracted to Desktop\drod\ThirdParty\libvorbis-1.2.0

Okay, now we have everything, but not all in useful form.
I think the goal here is to get all these built up so that I have one or more .lib and .h files.
(at least one per third party lib)

these are built for me: cURL, Expat, fmod, SDL, SDL_ttf. so on to build the rest.

28. double-clicked Desktop\drod\ThirdParty\metakit-2.4.9.7\win\msvc70\mksrc.sln
    that brought up the "upgrade wizard" which I let run (with backups).
    In the top menu I selected "Build" and drug down to "Configuration Manager..."
        In the resulting box, in the upper right was a dropdown labelled "Active solution configuration:"
        I dropped it down to "Debug", then hit the "Close" button
    in the solution explorer on the left, I right-clicked the "mklib" project and selected "Build".
    Then in the top menu I selected "Build" and drug down to "Configuration Manager..."
        In the resulting box, in the upper right was a dropdown labelled "Active solution configuration:"
        I dropped it down to "Release", then hit the "Close" button
    in the solution explorer on the left, I right-clicked the "mklib" project and selected "Build" again
    it built with some warnings, it seems I'm now done with metakit.
29. double-clicked Desktop\drod\ThirdParty\lpng1225\projects\visualc71\libpng.sln
    that brought up the "upgrade wizard" which I let run (with backups).
    In the top menu I selected "Build" and drug down to "Configuration Manager..."
        In the resulting box, in the upper right was a dropdown labelled "Active solution configuration:"
        I dropped it down to "LIB Release", then hit the "Close" button
    in the solution explorer on the left, I right-clicked "Solution 'libpng'" and selected "Build Solution".
    Then in the top menu I selected "Build" and drug down to "Configuration Manager..."
        In the resulting box, in the upper right was a dropdown labelled "Active solution configuration:"
        I dropped it down to "LIB Debug", then hit the "Close" button
    in the solution explorer on the left, I right-clicked "Solution 'libpng'" and selected "Build Solution" again.
    zlib and libpng both built, but pngtest failed. I ignored that (the problem is missing pngtest.png)
    (side note: copying pngtest.png from Desktop\drod\ThirdParty\lpng1225 to
    Desktop\drod\ThirdParty\lpng1225\projects\visualc71\Win32_LIB_Release\Test and manually running pngtest.exe
    resulted in success)
    it seems I'm now done with libpng and got zlib as a bonus.
30. double-clicked Desktop\drod\ThirdParty\freetype-2.1.4\builds\win32\visualc\freetype.dsw
    that brought up a converstion wizard, so I hit "yes to all".
    in the solution explorer on the left, I right-clicked "Solution 'freetype'" and selected "Build Solution".
    it built with some warnings, it seems I'm now done with freetype.
31. double-clicked Desktop\drod\ThirdParty\libogg-1.1.3\win32\ogg.dsw
    that brought up a converstion wizard, so I hit "yes to all".
    In the solution explorer on the left, I right-clicked "ogg_static" and selected "Build".
    Then in the top menu I selected "Build" and drug down to "Configuration Manager..."
        In the resulting box, in the upper right was a dropdown labelled "Active solution configuration:"
        I dropped it down to "Release", then hit the "Close" button
    in the solution explorer on the left, I right-clicked "ogg_static" and selected "Build" again
    it built with no warnings, so it seems I'm now done with libogg (though I possibly
    don't need this for DROD directly, I do need it for the next four steps)
32. double-clicked Desktop\drod\ThirdParty\libvorbis-1.2.0\win32\vorbisenc_static.dsp
    that brought up a converstion wizard, so I hit "yes to all".
    in the solution explorer on the left, I right-clicked on the "vorbisenc_static" project and selected "Properties"
    on the left side of that window, I selected "C/C++"
        in the top line on the right-hand box ("Additional Include Directories"),
        I changed "..\..\ogg\include" to "..\..\libogg-1.1.3\include"
    then I clicked "ok" to dismiss the properties window,
    In the solution explorer on the left, I right-clicked "vorbisenc_static" and selected "Build".
       this asked me to save "vorbisenc_static.sln", so I hit "Save" on that window.
    Then in the top menu I selected "Build" and drug down to "Configuration Manager..."
        In the resulting box, in the upper right was a dropdown labelled "Active solution configuration:"
        I dropped it down to "Release", then hit the "Close" button
    in the solution explorer on the left, I right-clicked "vorbisenc_static" and selected "Build" again
    it built with some warnings, so it seems I'm now done with vorbisenc.
33. double-clicked Desktop\drod\ThirdParty\libvorbis-1.2.0\win32\vorbisfile_static.dsp
    that brought up a converstion wizard, so I hit "yes to all".
    in the solution explorer on the left, I right-clicked on the "vorbisfile_static" project and selected "Properties"
    on the left side of that window, I selected "C/C++"
        in the top line on the right-hand box ("Additional Include Directories"),
        I changed "..\..\ogg\include" to "..\..\libogg-1.1.3\include"
    then I clicked "ok" to dismiss the properties window,

    Then in the top menu I selected "Build" and drug down to "Configuration Manager..."
        In the resulting box, in the upper right was a dropdown labelled "Active solution configuration:"
        I dropped it down to "Release", then hit the "Close" button
    in the solution explorer on the left, I right-clicked "vorbisfile_static" and selected "Build" again
    it built with some warnings, so it seems I'm now done with vorbisfile.
34. double-clicked Desktop\drod\ThirdParty\libvorbis-1.2.0\win32\vorbis_static.dsp
    that brought up a converstion wizard, so I hit "yes to all".
    in the solution explorer on the left, I right-clicked on the "vorbis_static" project and selected "Properties"
    on the left side of that window, I selected "C/C++"
        in the top line on the right-hand box ("Additional Include Directories"),
        I changed "..\..\ogg\include" to "..\..\libogg-1.1.3\include"
    then I clicked "ok" to dismiss the properties window,
    In the solution explorer on the left, I right-clicked "vorbisfile_static" and selected "Build".
       this asked me to save "vorbis_static.sln", so I hit "Save" on that window.
    Then in the top menu I selected "Build" and drug down to "Configuration Manager..."
        In the resulting box, in the upper right was a dropdown labelled "Active solution configuration:"
        I dropped it down to "Release", then hit the "Close" button
    in the solution explorer on the left, I right-clicked "vorbisfile_static" and selected "Build" again
    it built with some warnings, so it seems I'm now done with vorbis.
35. double-clicked Desktop\drod\ThirdParty\libtheora-1.0beta2\win32\theora_static.dsp
    that brought up a converstion wizard, so I hit "yes to all".
    in the solution explorer on the left, I right-clicked on the "theora_static" project and selected "Properties"
    on the left side of that window, I selected "C/C++"
        in the top line on the right-hand box ("Additional Include Directories"),
        I changed "..\..\ogg\include,..\..\theora\include" to "..\..\libogg-1.1.3\include,..\..\libtheora-1.0beta2\include,..\..\libtheora-1.0beta2\lib\enc"
    then on the left side of that window, I clicked on "Preprocessor" under "C/C++"
        in the top line on the right-hand box ("Preprocessor Definitions"),
        I added ";TH_REALLY_NO_ASSEMBLY" to the end of the existing entry
    then on the left side of that window, I clicked on "Librarian"
        I clicked in the top line on the right-hand box ("Additional Dependencies")
        and entered the path "..\..\libogg-1.1.3\win32\Static_Debug\ogg_static_d.lib"
    then I clicked "ok" to dismiss the properties window,
    In the solution explorer on the left, I right-clicked on the "theora_static" project and selected "Build"
        this asked me to save "theora_static.sln", so I hit "Save" on that window.
    in the solution explorer on the left, I right-clicked on the "theora_static" project and selected "Properties"
    in the upper left-hand side, I selected "Configuration" and drug down to "Release"
    on the left side of that window, I selected "C/C++"
        in the top line on the right-hand box ("Additional Include Directories"),
        I changed "..\..\ogg\include,..\..\theora\include" to "..\..\libogg-1.1.3\include,..\..\libtheora-1.0beta2\include,..\..\libtheora-1.0beta2\lib\enc"
    then on the left side of that window, I clicked on "Preprocessor" under "C/C++"
        in the top line on the right-hand box ("Preprocessor Definitions"),
        I added ";TH_REALLY_NO_ASSEMBLY" to the end of the existing entry
    then on the left side of that window, I clicked on "Librarian"
        I clicked in the top line on the right-hand box ("Additional Dependencies")
        and entered the path "..\..\libogg-1.1.3\win32\Static_Debug\ogg_static_d.lib"
    then I clicked "ok" to dismiss the properties window,
    Then in the top menu I selected "Build" and drug down to "Configuration Manager..."
        In the resulting box, in the upper right was a dropdown labelled "Active solution configuration:"
        I dropped it down to "Release", then hit the "Close" button
    In the solution explorer on the left, I right-clicked on the "theora_static" project and selected "Build" again
    it built with some warnings, it seems I'm now done with libtheora.
36. I opened up a command prompt and typed the following commands:
        cd Desktop\drod\ThirdParty\jpeg-6b
        "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 8\Common7\Tools\vsvars32.bat"
        set INCLUDE=%INCLUDE%;C:\Program Files\Microsoft Platform SDK for Windows Server 2003 R2\Include
        set LIB=%LIB%;C:\Program Files\Microsoft Platform SDK for Windows Server 2003 R2\Lib
        copy jconfig.vc jconfig.h
        nmake /f makefile.vc nodebug=1
    it seems I'm now done with libjpeg.

now all my third-party libraries are built, it's time to move on to actually compiling DROD itself. yay.

37. I started up Visual C++ and on the top menu selected "Tools" and then scrolled down to "Options".
    In the resulting dialog box, in the navigator on the left, I opened up "Projects and Solutions" and under
    that selected "VC++ Directories". Once I selected that, there was a drop-down on the upper-right of the dialog
    box. I scrolled down to "Include files" in that. In directory list I started clicking the blank line below the
    already existing directories, then pasting in each of these lines, one at a time:
        C:\Documents and Settings\silver Harloe\Desktop\drod\ThirdParty\Expat-2.0.0\Source\lib
        C:\Documents and Settings\silver Harloe\Desktop\drod\ThirdParty\SDL-1.2.12\include
        C:\Documents and Settings\silver Harloe\Desktop\drod\ThirdParty\SDL_ttf-2.0.8\include
        C:\Documents and Settings\silver Harloe\Desktop\drod\ThirdParty\fmodapi375win\api\inc
        C:\Documents and Settings\silver Harloe\Desktop\drod\ThirdParty\jpeg-6b
        C:\Documents and Settings\silver Harloe\Desktop\drod\ThirdParty\libcurl-7.15.2-win32-msvc\include
        C:\Documents and Settings\silver Harloe\Desktop\drod\ThirdParty\libogg-1.1.3\include
        C:\Documents and Settings\silver Harloe\Desktop\drod\ThirdParty\libvorbis-1.2.0\include
        C:\Documents and Settings\silver Harloe\Desktop\drod\ThirdParty\libtheora-1.0beta2\include
        C:\Documents and Settings\silver Harloe\Desktop\drod\ThirdParty\lpng1225
        C:\Documents and Settings\silver Harloe\Desktop\drod\ThirdParty\metakit-2.4.9.7\include
        C:\Documents and Settings\silver Harloe\Desktop\drod\ThirdParty\zlib
38. With the dialog still open, I went back to the drop-down in the upper-right and scrolled it down to
    "Library files". Using the same click and paste one line at a time (darn them for refusing multi-line pastes),
    I added all these lines to that list:
        C:\Documents and Settings\silver Harloe\Desktop\drod\ThirdParty\Expat-2.0.0\Bin
        C:\Documents and Settings\silver Harloe\Desktop\drod\ThirdParty\SDL-1.2.12\lib
        C:\Documents and Settings\silver Harloe\Desktop\drod\ThirdParty\SDL_ttf-2.0.8\lib
        C:\Documents and Settings\silver Harloe\Desktop\drod\ThirdParty\fmodapi375win\api\lib
        C:\Documents and Settings\silver Harloe\Desktop\drod\ThirdParty\freetype-2.1.4\objs
        C:\Documents and Settings\silver Harloe\Desktop\drod\ThirdParty\jpeg-6b
        C:\Documents and Settings\silver Harloe\Desktop\drod\ThirdParty\libcurl-7.15.2-win32-msvc
        C:\Documents and Settings\silver Harloe\Desktop\drod\ThirdParty\libogg-1.1.3\win32\Static_Release
        C:\Documents and Settings\silver Harloe\Desktop\drod\ThirdParty\libogg-1.1.3\win32\Static_Debug
        C:\Documents and Settings\silver Harloe\Desktop\drod\ThirdParty\libvorbis-1.2.0\win32\VorbisEnc_Static_Release
        C:\Documents and Settings\silver Harloe\Desktop\drod\ThirdParty\libvorbis-1.2.0\win32\VorbisEnc_Static_Debug
        C:\Documents and Settings\silver Harloe\Desktop\drod\ThirdParty\libvorbis-1.2.0\win32\VorbisFile_Static_Release
        C:\Documents and Settings\silver Harloe\Desktop\drod\ThirdParty\libvorbis-1.2.0\win32\VorbisFile_Static_Debug
        C:\Documents and Settings\silver Harloe\Desktop\drod\ThirdParty\libvorbis-1.2.0\win32\Vorbis_Static_Release
        C:\Documents and Settings\silver Harloe\Desktop\drod\ThirdParty\libvorbis-1.2.0\win32\Vorbis_Static_Debug
        C:\Documents and Settings\silver Harloe\Desktop\drod\ThirdParty\libtheora-1.0beta2\win32\Static_Release
        C:\Documents and Settings\silver Harloe\Desktop\drod\ThirdParty\libtheora-1.0beta2\win32\Static_Debug
        C:\Documents and Settings\silver Harloe\Desktop\drod\ThirdParty\lpng1225\projects\visualc71\Win32_LIB_Release
        C:\Documents and Settings\silver Harloe\Desktop\drod\ThirdParty\lpng1225\projects\visualc71\Win32_LIB_Release\ZLib
        C:\Documents and Settings\silver Harloe\Desktop\drod\ThirdParty\lpng1225\projects\visualc71\Win32_LIB_Debug
        C:\Documents and Settings\silver Harloe\Desktop\drod\ThirdParty\lpng1225\projects\visualc71\Win32_LIB_Debug\ZLib
        C:\Documents and Settings\silver Harloe\Desktop\drod\ThirdParty\metakit-2.4.9.7\builds
    Then I went ahead and closed Visual C++ because I'm more comfortable with explorer than VC for doing the first part
    of the next step.
39. So, finally I explored to Desktop\drod\DROD32Source\Master and double-clicked on Master.sln. This opened up
    Visual C++ with the DROD solution ready to go.
    I right-clicked on on the "drod" project in the navigator on the left, and scrolled down to "Properties"
        In the resulting dialog box, in the navigator on the left, I opened up "Configuration Properties",
        and under that "C/C++", and under that selected "Preprocessor". In the box on the right, I edited the
        "Preprocessor Definitions" and removed the ";CARAVELBUILD" from the end.
    In the upper left-hand side, I selected "Configuration" and drug down to "Release"
        Then once again made sure "C/C++", and under that "Preprocessor" was selected. In the box on the right, I edited the
        "Preprocessor Definitions" and removed the ";CARAVELBUILD" from the end.
    I right-clicked on on the "DRODUtil" project in the navigator on the left, and scrolled down to "Properties"
        In the resulting dialog box, in the navigator on the left, I opened up "Configuration Properties",
        and under that "Linker", and under that selected "Input". In the box on the right, I edited the
        "Additional Dependencies" and edited the part where it says "mk4vc60s_d.lib" to read "mk4vc70s_d.lib",
        and edited "libjpegd.lib" to read "libjpeg.lib"
    I right-clicked on on the "drod" project in the navigator on the left, and scrolled down to "Properties"
        In the resulting dialog box, in the navigator on the left, I opened up "Configuration Properties",
        and under that "Linker", and under that selected "Input". In the box on the right, I edited the
        "Additional Dependencies" and edited the part where it says "libjpegd.lib" to read "libjpeg.lib"
    I right-clicked "Solution 'Master'" in the navigator on the left, and selected "Build Solution".
    Pause for dramatic effect (and because it took a while to compile).

    I got an error compiling DRODUtil, but that's an optional, separate .exe - drod.exe was built and works -
    Also, when I rebuild the Master solution as a "release," DRODUtil built just fine.

Time to test.

40. I went http://www.caravelgames.com/distfiles/DRODTCBDemoSetup.exe and saved that file to the Desktop\drod folder
    Then I clicked the installer but changed the install path to "C:\Documents and Settings\silver Harloe\Desktop\drod\Test Build Debug",
    and changed the Start Menu folder to "DROD - TCB Test Build", and unclicked "create a desktop icon". When it was done installing,
    I did not allow it to launch yet.
41. In the folder "C:\Documents and Settings\silver Harloe\Desktop\drod\Test Build Debug" I created a subfolder called "orig" and
    moved drod.exe into it, then I copied in the drod.exe from "C:\Documents and Settings\silver Harloe\Desktop\drod\DROD32Source\DROD\Debug"
42. I ran and played the DROD demo.
