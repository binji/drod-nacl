<h3><u>Character Script Commands</u></h3>
<p>When the player enters the room, NPCs start performing the behavior you
designate.  There are four general classes of script commands, as follows:</p>
<ol>
  <li><a href="#placement">Placement</a></li>
  <li><a href="#condition">Condition</a></li>
  <li><a href="#interaction">Interaction</a></li>
  <li><a href="#queries">Queries</a></li>

</p>
<hr />
<p><a name="placement"><b>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Placement</b></a> - Change the NPC's location.</p>
<ol>
  <li><a name="appear"><b>Appear</b></a> - If not visible, the NPC will appear
      at the current square (i.e. it enters the room).  This command does
      nothing if the NPC is already visible. If a monster or the player occupies
      the square it is appearing in, then the NPC will wait until the square is
      vacant to appear.</li>
  <li><a name="appearat"><b>Appear at</b></a> - Use this to have an invisible
      NPC enter the room at a designated square different from the one where the
      NPC is current located. After selecting this command, the room will
      temporarily appear.  Click on a square to select where the NPC will enter
      the room. This command does nothing if the NPC is already visible.  If a
      monster or the player occupies the square the NPC is to appear in, it will
      wait until the square becomes vacant to appear.</li>
  <li><a name="disappear"><b>Disappear</b></a> - Removes the NPC from the room,
      making him invisible. Use this to show an NPC leaving the room. Script
      commands continue to play while the character is invisible but the NPC
      will not physically interact with any room elements unless it Appears
      again.</li>
  <li><a name="moveto"><b>Move to</b></a> - The NPC will move to the indicated
      square (selected by clicking on a room square, as above).  Optionally, one
      of the entity types listed in the adjacent list box may be selected as who
      the NPC should follow. Hold &lt;Ctrl&gt; while clicking to select and
      unselect multiple selections. Each turn, the NPC will attempt to move one
      square closer to its destination. It moves roughly in a straight line and
      won't move on a given turn if something is in its way.
      <a name="forbidturning">Enable</a> "Forbid turning" if you don't want the
      monster turning to face the direction it is moving each step. Hint: If you
      want the NPC to move in a more complex fashion, such as following a
      twisting corridor, this can be accomplished with a sequence of <b>Move
      to</b> commands, one to navigate each twist in the corridor.  This command
      finishes when the NPC arrives at the destination square.
      <a name="singlestep">Enable</a> "Single step" to have the NPC only attempt
      to make a single step toward the indicated destination before continuing
      to the next script command.  If no move can be made, the next script
      command is executed immediately.</li>
  <li><a name="move"><b>Move</b></a> - Similar to <a href="#moveto"><b>Move
      to</b></a>, except a relative number of tiles to move from the NPC's
      current location is specified.  Positive numbers indicate movement south
      and east, and negative numbers are for moving north and west.</li>
  <li><a name="facedirection"><b>Face direction</b></a> - Initially, the NPC
      faces the direction it is oriented when placed in the room.  Use this
      command to turn the NPC in a different direction without moving (takes 1
      turn).</li>
</ol>

  <p>
    <a name="condition"><b>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Condition</b></a> - How the NPC
    functions.</p>
  <ol>
    <li><a name="setappearance"><b>Set appearance</b>
      </a> - Changes the NPC's "Graphic" and default properties to the specified entity type.</li>
    <li><a name="turnintomonster"><b>Turn into monster</b>
      </a> - Turns the NPC into a regular monster of the type indicated by its graphic.
      This ends script execution immediately and the NPC is permanently replaced by a regular monster.</li>
    <li><a name="imperative"><b>Imperative</b></a> - Sets a special status
      condition on the NPC (see <a href="#imperativelist">Imperatives</a>).
      Compatible imperatives may be combined.</li>
  </ol>
  
<p><a name="interaction"><b>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;Interaction</b></a> - How the NPC
interacts with its environment.</p>
<ol>
  <li><a name="activateat"><b>Activate item at</b></a> - Activates the item at
      the room square you select. Items that can be activated are: orbs,
      pressure plates, lights and wall lights. Nothing will happen this turn if
      no relevant item is at the indicated square. Hint: Move the character next
      to orbs before striking them for more intuitive behavior.  If no one is
      next to the orb when struck, it will appear that Beethro is using his
      portable orb.</li>
  <li><a name="speech"><b>Speech</b></a> - Causes someone in the room to say
      something.<br />
      <a name="dialogtext"><u>Dialog text</u></a>: Type the words that are said.
      This may be left blank in order to only play a sound effect.<br />
      <a name="speaker"><u>Speaker</u></a>: who says the words. The text appears
      next to the person's figure in the room and their face appears on screen
      while they are speaking.  Use "Custom" to have the NPC "throw its voice"
      to a different square in the room.  If a monster or character is located
      at the indicated square when this command is executed, it will appear as
      if this monster or character is speaking. If speaker is set to "None", or
      the person indicated is not present in the room, then the words will
      appear next to the NPC.<br />
      <a name="mood"><u>Mood</u></a>: the face displays the indicated mood.  Not
      all moods are available for all speaker types.<br />
      <a name="speechdelay"><u>Speech delay</u></a>: How long, in milliseconds,
      the speech lasts for.  If placing multiple lines of speech in sequence,
      this determines how much time passes until the next line of speech (and
      corresponding speaker) is displayed.  Set this value to zero to have the
      game engine calculate how long to wait based on the length of the speech
      text.<br />
      <a name="addsound"><u>Add sound</u></a>: A sound file (Wave or Ogg Vorbis
      format) on disk can be optionally attached to the speech.  If a sound is
      specified, it will play along with the text and the next speech command
      will be played when the sound completes. Use a non-zero speech delay to
      force when the next line of speech will play regardless of how long the
      attached sound file plays.<br />
      <a name="exportspeech"><u>Exporting speech text</u></a>: A hold's entire
      speech script can be exported to an HTML file on disk when exporting the
      hold by adding the line "ExportSpeech=1" to the "[Startup]" section of
      Data/drod.ini.
  </li>
  <li><a name="flushspeech"><b>Flush Speech (on/off)</b></a> - Tells the game to
      immediately process any previously queued speech that hasn't had time to
      play yet.  If "On" is selected, these texts will appear immediately
      onscreen.  If "Off" is selected, then text that hasn't played yet won't
      show at all. Hint: This command is used for dramatic effect, to ensure
      speech queued after this command will be immediately spoken, as intended.
      This command is not needed if it doesn't matter at what point in play
      speech texts are delivered.</li>
  <li><a name="ambient"><b>Ambient sound</b></a> - Plays a custom sound effect,
      imported from a sound file on disk.  Select "Loop Off" to play the sound
      once, and "Loop On" to play the sound repeatedly.  Selecting no sound file
      in conjunction with this command will silence any ambient sounds playing
      when the command is executed.</li>
  <li><a name="ambientat"><b>Ambient sound at</b></a> - Plays a custom sound
      effect, imported from a sound file on disk, from the room location you
      specify.  The sound will play from the direction the sound is coming to
      the player in the room and will be quieter the further the player is away
      from that room tile.  Selecting no sound file in conjunction with this
      command will silence any ambient sounds currently playing at the room
      location you specify.</li>
  <li><a name="buildmarker"><b>Build marker</b></a> - Mark a region of the room
      for building a certain object by citizen builders.  When a builder builds
      on a tile, the tile is unmarked. Each room tile can be marked only by a
      single object type at a time. Selecting "None" unmarks any existing build
      markers in the room region you specify.</li>
  <li><a name="gotoentrance"><b>Go to level entrance</b></a> - Sends the player
      immediately to any level entrance defined in the hold, or ends the hold.</li>
  <li><a name="playvideo"><b>Play video</b></a> - Plays a video file, imported
      from a video file on disk, at the specified screen coordinates.  Sound
      tracks in video files are not supported, but sounds and music may be
      played concurrently with the proper script commands.
      <a name="supportedvideo">Currently</a>, only Ogg Theora video format is
      supported.</li>
  <li><a name="setmusic"><b>Set music</b></a> - Set any of the available music
      themes to play. Additionally, custom music, imported from a music file on
      disk, may be played. Only Ogg Vorbis and Wave formats are supported.
      Custom music can be set to continue playing across rooms by executing this
      command on room entrance.</li>
  <li><a name="role"><b>Player role</b></a> - Indefinitely sets the player to
      play the role you indicate. In these roles, properties that apply to that
      entity type generally hold.</li>
  <li><a name="setplayersword"><b>Set player sword</b></a> - For player roles
      that wield a sword, this command indefinitely takes the player's sword
      away or gives it back.</li>
  <li><a name="cutscene"><b>Cut scene</b></a> - When set, room turns will
      proceed automatically at the rate you specify without player intervention.
      Invoke this command with a rate of "0" to end the cut scene and return
      movement control to the player. Hint: This command is used for dramatic
      effect, to have NPCs do things, such as move around the room, without
      requiring the player to take turns to allow the NPCs to likewise move.
      If on a given turn no NPCs are executing, the cut scene playing will
      automatically terminate, restoring control to the player.</li>
  <li><a name="answer"><b>Answer option</b></a> - Provides a multiple choice
      option for a <a href="#question"><b>Question</b></a> command (see below).
      A label from the list of defined <a href="#label"><b>Label</b></a>
      commands in the script must be selected as the point from where the script
      will continue execution if the user selects this choice.
      Up to nine answer options are supported for a given Question.  Any
      additional options are ignored.</li>
  <li><a name="setvar"><b>Set var</b></a> - Each hold you create contains a set
      of zero or more variables, named by you.  Use these variables to track
      persistent game state information across rooms during play. To add a variable
      to a hold, type its name into the uppermost text box and click "Add".
	  Variable names must begin with a letter and not contain any punctuation
	  except underscore ('_').  
      To permanently remove a hold variable, select it from the list box on the
      left and click "Remove".  Note that this removes the variable completely
      from the hold and all NPC scripts that use it, not just from this
      particular script.<br />
      <a name="varops">Select</a> a hold variable from the list, choose an
      operation and a value. Variables may either store an integer or text. If
      the operation you specify is "Assign text" or "Add text", the variable you
      select will be set to store the text you provide. You may also reference
	  other variables to insert into the given text.  For operations dealing
      with numbers, if you provide the name of another variable, its value will
      be used (invalid names will be considered a value of 0). Otherwise, the
      number you provide is used. Use the text box on top to specify the text
      being assigned or added to the variable. For other operations, use the
      text box on the right to input a number or variable name. The variable
      will store a number.<br />
      <a name="varsintext"><u>Using vars in text</u></a>:
    In variable text assignments,
    <a href="#speech">Speech</a>, <a href="#question">Questions</a>
      (see below), level entrance texts, and scroll text,
      type "$&lt;var name&gt;$" to insert the
      current value of the variable you name at this point in the text.
	  Type "$\n$" to skip to the next line of text.<br />
      <a name="varref"><u>Comprehensive variable reference list</u></a>:
      In the <a href="editroom.html">Room Editor Screen</a>, press F2 to output
      a comprehensive list of hold variables to the clipboard (use the paste
      option of your favorite text editor to view this text). This list shows
      all rooms and NPC (x,y) locations where the variable is referenced in a
      script throughout the hold. A number after the (x,y) location of the
      script indicates how many times the variable is referenced in that script.<br />
      <a name="varmonitor"><u>Monitoring variables during play</u></a>:
      Press Ctrl-F7 while playing to turn on and off the variable monitor.
      Whenever a script changes a hold variable, you will be notified onscreen.
      This only works while playtesting, playing a hold you authored, or playing
      a CaravelNet hold in beta.</li>
  <li><a name="ghost"><b>Ghost display</b>
    </a>: When the NPC is not in the room, the NPC's image will appear at its current coordinates anyway.</li>
  <li><a name="noghost"><b>No ghost display</b>
    </a>: When the NPC is not in the room, it is not displayed (default).</li>
  <li><a name="setshallowwatertraversal"><b>Set shallow water traversal</b>
    </a> - Sets how and under what conditions the player interacts with shallow water terrain.</li>
  <li><a name="gameeffect"><b>Game effect</b>
  </a> - Display a visual effect at a specified room location.  Particle effects may have a direction
    given them.  Some effects may play an optional accompanying sound effect.</li>
  <li><a name="generateentity"><b>Generate entity</b>
    </a> - Creates a new
    entity of the specified type at room location (x,y) and the indicated
    orientation once that room tile is vacant.  Custom NPCs with a default
    script defined may be created where an entity already occupies the room tile,
    but begins as not visible.
    NPCs will begin executing their default script when created.</li>
  <li><a name="startglobalscript"><b>Start global script</b>
    </a> - Begin executing the specified NPC's default script.
    To use this command, first create a custom NPC role, then give it a default script.
    The global script will run in each room you enter.
    Only one instance of each custom NPC may be run as a global script while in any given room.</li>
</ol>

<p><a name="queries"><b>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;Queries</b></a> - Use queries to examine
the state of the room and wait indefinitely until certain events occur.</p>
<ol>
  <li><a name="question"><b>Question</b></a> - If one or more <a href="#answer">
      <b>Answer option</b></a> commands have been provided previously in script
      execution, this will ask the user a multiple choice question with the
      dialogue you specify and answer options previously provided. Script
      execution will continue from the label of the Answer option selected by
      the player.  Once a <b>Question</b> has been asked, the list of Answer
      options is reset for the next <b>Question</b>.<br />
      If no <a href="#answer"><b>Answer option</b></a> commands have been
      provided before this command is executed, the user will be asked a "Yes"
      or "No" question with the dialogue you specify. If a yes/no
      <b>Question</b> is executed as the condition for an <a href="#if">
      <b>If ...</b></a> command, the corresponding script block will execute if
      the user answers "Yes".</li>
  <li><a name="wait"><b>Wait</b></a> - This tells the NPC to do nothing until
      the number of game turns you specify has passed.  <b>Wait 0</b> will stop
      the script at the current point until the next turn.</li>
  <li><a name="waitevent"><b>Wait for event</b></a> - The NPC waits until the
      specified game event has taken place.</li>
  <li><a name="waitentity"><b>Wait for entity</b></a> - The NPC waits for any of
      the selected entity type (or entities) to enter the room region you
      specify.  Hold &lt;Ctrl&gt; while clicking to select and unselect multiple
      selections.  After selecting this command, the room will temporarily
      appear.  Hold down the mouse button and drag the mouse cursor to select
      the area any of the entity or entities must enter before the NPC does
      anything else.</li>
  <li><a name="waitentityis"><b>Wait while entity</b></a> - Wait while any of
      the selected entity type remains in the room region that you select.</li>
  <li><a name="waitdoor"><b>Wait for door to (open/close)</b></a> - Waits for
      the door at the selected room square to either open or close.</li>
  <li><a name="waitturn"><b>Wait for turn</b></a> - The NPC does nothing until
      at least the specified number of game turns has passed since the player
      entered the room.</li>
  <li><a name="waitclean"><b>Wait for clean room</b></a> - Waits until the room
      is in a conquer-ready state (i.e. all kill-required monsters have been
      removed).</li>
  <li><a name="waitplayerface"><b>Wait for player to face</b></a> - Waits until
      the player turns in the specified direction.</li>
  <li><a name="waitplayermove"><b>Wait for player to move</b></a> - Waits until
      the player moves in the specified direction.</li>
  <li><a name="waitplayertouch"><b>Wait for player to touch me</b></a> - Waits
      until the player bumps into the NPC.</li>
  <li><a name="waitnobuildmarkers"><b>Wait for no building markers</b></a> -
      Waits until no script-defined <a href="#buildmarker">building markers</a>
      exist in the room region you specify.</li>
  <li><a name="waitvar"><b>Wait until var</b></a> - Waits until a <a href="#setvar">
      hold variable</a> meets the condition you specify.</li>
  <li><a name="waitforitem"><b>Wait for item</b>
    </a> - Wait until the specified element is located in the marked room region.</li>
</ol>

<p><a name="decision"><b>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;Decision making</b></a> - Use the
following commands to execute only a marked portion of script commands or to
continue executing script commands from a different location in the script.</p>
<ol>
  <li><a name="if"><b>If ...</b></a> - Use this command to optionally run a
      block of one or more script commands, based on a condition you specify in
      the next script command, which must be a query. If the query is
      immediately satisfied, then the script commands that follow after will be
      executed.  An <a href="#ifend"><b>If End</b></a> or
      <a href="#else"><b>Else</b></a> command indicates the end of the optional
      code block. If the following query is not true, the script will continue
      after the following the next <a href="#else"><b>Else</b></a> or
      <a href="#ifend"><b>If End</b></a> command that marks the end of the
      optional code block.</li>
  <li><a name="if"><b>If ...</b></a>. The end of the <a href="#else"><b>Else</b></a>
      block is indicated with an <a href="#ifend"><b>If End</b></a> command.</li>
  <li><a name="else"><b>Else</b></a> - Marks the beginning of a script section
      that is executed if the query condition following the
      <a href="#if"><b>If ...</b></a> command is <u>not</u> satisfied.
      <b>Else</b> commands in conditional blocks are optional, but they must
      always follow somewhere after an <a href="#if"><b>If ...</b></a> to be
      meaningful.</li>
  <li><a name="ifend"><b>If End</b></a> - Marks the end of
      <a href="#if"><b>If ...</b></a> and <a href="#else"><b>Else</b></a> blocks.<br />
      <a name="condnotes">Notes:</a>
      <ol>
        <li>A "?" symbol displayed in front of a command in the script list
            means the command is not a recognized as a valid condition for an
            <a href="#if"><b>If ...</b></a> command.</li>
        <li><a href="#if"><b>If ...</b></a> commands may be nested, i.e., an
            inner code block may be completely contained within an outer code
            block.</li>
        <li>A "!" symbol displayed in front of a command in the script list
            means that an <a href="#if"><b>If ...</b></a> or

      commands).  Also, labels may be used to simply comment in normal language
      on what the following script commands do.</li>
  <li><a name="goto"><b>Go to</b></a> - Select a label to continue executing
      commands from.  Hint: Use Goto to make a loop in the script that repeats a
      sequence of commands over and over. Use a <a href="#wait"><b>Wait 0</b></a>
      command as the last statement of a loop that is to be executed once each
      turn.</li>
  <li><a name="endonexit"><b>End on room exit</b></a> - Removes the NPC for the
      rest of the current game once the player exits the room.  If the room is
      restarted before exit, then the NPC script will begin executing again from
      the beginning. Hint: use this command to have the NPC continue executing
      commands.</li>
  <li><a name="setappearance"><b>Set appearance</b></a> - Changes the NPC's
      "Graphic" and default properties to the specified entity type.</li>
  <li><a name="end"><b>End</b></a> - Ends the character script immediately and
      will remove the NPC for the rest of the current game once the player exits
      the room. If the room is restarted before exit, then the NPC script will
      begin executing again from the beginning. Hint: use this command to stop
      the NPC from executing any more commands.</li>

<p><a name="usagenotes"><b>Notes about using NPC scripts</b></a></p>
<ol>
  <li><a name="lifecycle">Each</a> character script begins execution when the

<p><a name="imperativelist"><b>Imperatives</b>
</a> - NPC/script properties that may be set with the <a href="#imperative">Imperative</a> command.</p>
  <ol>
    <li><a name="impvulnerable"><u>Vulnerable</u></a>: Makes the NPC vulnerable to
      killing. This is the default setting for most NPC graphic types.</li>
    <li><a name="impinvulnerable"><u>Invulnerable</u></a>: Makes the NPC
      invincible so it cannot be killed by stabbing or other methods of
      inflicting damage. The NPC may still be killed by falling off a platform
      or by briar growth.  Some NPC types, like Wubbas, are invulnerable by
      default.</li>
    <li><a name="impcritical"><u>Critical hero</u></a>: When set, the room will
      restart if the NPC is ever killed. Some NPC types, like Beethro and Halph,
      are marked critical heros by default.</li>
    <li><a name="imprequired"><u>Required target</u></a>: When set, the NPC must
      be killed in order to conquer the room.  This command only applies when
      the room is not otherwise clean on entrance.</li>
    <li><a name="impsafe"><u>Safe</u></a>: Forbids the NPC to step on the player
      and kill him (default).</li>
    <li><a name="impswordsafe"><u>Sword safe to player</u></a>: Sword stabs from
      this NPC won't harm the player.</li>
    <li><a name="impdeadly"><u>Deadly</u></a>: Allows the NPC to step on the
      player and kill him.  Also makes sword hits deadly to the player (default).</li>
    <li><a name="impdie"><u>Die</u></a>: Makes the NPC die with a blood splatter.</li>
    <li><a name="impdiespecial"><u>Die special</u></a>: Makes the NPC perform a
      monster-specific death sequence, if applicable.  Currently, this command
      applies to rock golems and fegundos. Rock golem NPCs will turn into a rock
      pile when this command is invoked. Fegundos will explode and turn into a
      regular fegundo ash monster. For other monster types, this acts
      identically to "Die".</li>
    <li><a name="impendwhenkilled"><u>End when killed</u></a>: If the NPC is killed,
      mark the script as ended so it doesn't repeat when the room is reentered.</li>
    <li><a name="impdirectonlybeelining"><u>Direct-only beelining</u></a>: When the
      desired diagonal movement is blocked, then don't move at all.</li>
    <li><a name="impflexiblebeelining"><u>Flexible beelining</u></a>: When the
      desired diagonal movement is blocked, then choose the better of
      horizontal or vertical movement to approach the destination (default).</li>
