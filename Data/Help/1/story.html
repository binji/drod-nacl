<h3><u>The Story</u></h3>
<p>
Beethro Budkin is a fifth-generation Smitemaster - an expert swordsman employed to clear out dungeons infested with deadly monsters.
He recently cleared out all twenty-five floors of King Dugan's Dungeon in Dugandy, gaining great notoriety in the Smitemasters Guild.
Beethro has just opened the Roasted Roach Grill, a bustling new restaurant.
He manages the joint in his free time between dungeon-clearing contractual work.
</p><p>
Join Beethro as he tells his nephews a tale of his grandfather, Gunthro Budkin.
Gunthro is another renowned Smitemaster, currently employed in the cold, harsh land of Rasarus.
This is the tale of an epic war between Rasarus and Tueno, spanning three continents.
</p><p>
Beethro lives in a world called The Eighth, currently named so because it was found to have the shape of one-eighth of a pie.
