  <li>A list of demos recorded in this room, if any, will be displayed
      on the left side of the screen. &nbsp;Detailed information for the
      selected demo appears on the right. &nbsp;Select the demo you would
      like to watch or delete.  <a name="displayall">Click</a> the "Display all demos in level" checkbox

      the selected demo.  While viewing a demo, press Space or Keypad-5 to
      pause and unpause playback, the Up arrow to speed up playback
      and the Down arrow to slow playback (each keypress is cumulative).  Press

      delete the entire multiroom playback or only the segment from the current room.

	  When deleting all demos, you will also be prompted whether you want to
	  delete all other user demos recorded for the hold.</li>

      "Show from title screen".  This will show the selected demo from the Title
      Screen when your hold is active.  The order the demos are shown from the
      Title Screen is determined by the order the demos are marked.</li>
  <li>When you are done, click the "Return to Game" button.</li>
</ol>
<p><a name="importexport"><b>Importing/exporting demos:</b></a></p>

scored demos for each room once they have conquered it.

on in the <a href="settings.html">Settings screen</a>, DROD will automatically
download a list of the best scores for the current room.  Select one and press
"Download" to download the score demo from CaravelNet.  Once the download has completed and
the demo has been imported into your game, select the level or room the demo
was recorded in.  It will appear in the upper list of
local demos and you may watch it by selecting it and pressing "Watch".</p>
<p><a name="submit"><b>Submitting demos to CaravelNet:</b></a></p>

Registered CaravelNet users may submit selected demos authored by them
for scoring on CaravelNet.  Select one or more demos from the list and click
the Upload button to submit them.  In order to upload demos, the current hold
