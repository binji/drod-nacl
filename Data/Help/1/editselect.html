<h3><u>Level Editor</u></h3>
<p>The Level Editor is reached by choosing "<b>B</b>uild levels" from the
<a href="commands.html">Main Menu</a>.&nbsp; You can use it to edit any
hold (dungeon), level or room in the game's data file.</p>
<p>The Level Editor has the following options available:</p>
<p><a name="choosehold"><b>Choose Hold</b></a> - Click on the name of any hold in the list to edit it.
Add a new one of your own by clicking "New Hold". &nbsp;You will be asked to
provide your new hold with a name that users will see it by.&nbsp; Click "Settings"
to bring up a dialog to change the hold name, description, or to provide a
personalized message that players will see upon finishing your hold.&nbsp;
Click "Copy" to make a duplicate copy of the selected hold.&nbsp; Click "Manage"
to switch to the <a href="holdselect.html">Hold Management Screen</a>, from
which you may choose to permanently delete a hold or save a hold to a file on disk.
Exporting a hold to disk allows you to share it with other players,
and it is suggested you back up your holds to disk regularly as you work on them.</p>
<p><a name="editprivileges"><b>Who Can Edit?</b></a> - Each hold is
accessible in the editor depending on its editing
privileges.&nbsp; The "Who Can Edit?" box specifies which
players can view and edit your hold.&nbsp; "Anyone" means that any
player who has imported your hold can view and
modify it any way they want to (this is the default).&nbsp; Selecting
"You and Conquerors" means that a player will be
able to view and edit your hold once they have completed it (found a
stairway exiting the hold). "You and Masters" means only players who have
conquered the hold and found and conquered 100% of the hold's secret rooms
may have access to it.  "Only You" means that no other player besides the author
can ever access the hold in the editor.</p>
<p><a name="modifiedcopy">When</a> you modify a room in someone else's hold, you will be asked to
confirm the changes before saving.&nbsp; If you agree, a modified copy of the
original hold will be made and you become listed as the creator of the new,
modified hold.&nbsp; The hold name and description are changed
accordingly.&nbsp; This denotes to you and other players that your
version of the hold is a modification of someone else's hold.  If you decline
making your own copy of the hold, your changes will not be saved.</p>
<p><a name="chooselevel"><b>Choose Level</b></a> - Choose any of the levels
in the selected hold to edit them.&nbsp; Choose one from the level list to
select it, or add one of your own by clicking "New Level". &nbsp;You
will be asked to provide your new level with a name that
users will see when playing.&nbsp; Click "Rename" to change the level name
or "Describe" to change the description (the introductory text of the main level
entrance) at any time.&nbsp; Click "Delete" to permanently erase the selected
level from the game.&nbsp; Hit &lt;Ctrl-X&gt; or &lt;Ctrl-C&gt;
to copy a level. &nbsp;Hit &lt;Ctrl-V&gt; to paste that level
to the currently selected position in the level list.  <a name="rearrange">You</a> can rearrange
the order of your hold's levels by clicking on a level name and dragging it
with the mouse to a new position.  The first level in the list is always
where a new game starts.</p>
<p><a name="levelsettings"><b>Level Settings</b></a> - Displays
the author of the selected level, the date the level was created, and whether
the "Exit Level!" message should be shown when all required rooms in the level
have been conquered.</p>
<p><a name="chooseroom"><b>Choose Room</b></a> - Click on the
level map to select any room in the selected level.&nbsp; A miniature view of the room will be
displayed in the bottom right corner of the screen.&nbsp; Click on
a blank area of the map adjacent to an existing room to
add a new room to the level at
that location. &nbsp;Hit &lt;Ctrl-C&gt; to copy the selected room on the map.&nbsp;
Press &lt;Ctrl-X&gt; to cut a room for pasting in a different location. &nbsp;
Hit &lt;Ctrl-V&gt; to paste that room to the currently
selected spot on the map. &nbsp;Hit the &lt;delete&gt; key to
permanently erase a room.</p>
<p><a name="roomstyle"><b>Room Style</b></a> - Each room can have a given style, or motif (graphics and music),
associated with it. &nbsp;Choose one from the list to set the selected
room to that motif.  If you hold down the Control key while selecting a new style,
all the rooms in the level will be set to the new style.</p>
<p><a name="weather"><b>Weather</b></a> - Each room has its own environmental settings.  To configure
them, click Weather to bring up <a href="weather.html">this dialog</a>.</p>
<p><a name="required"><b>Required Room</b></a> - Check this box
to require players to beat the selected room before the level
can be completed (i.e., blue doors open).&nbsp; If no monsters exist in
a required room, the player is at least required to visit it
once before exiting the level.&nbsp; Unchecking this box means the player does
not have to visit or conquer the selected room in order to complete the level.</p>
<p><a name="secret"><b>Secret Room</b></a> - Check this box to mark this room as a secret room.
Secret rooms found by a player are tallied for each level on the <a href="restore.html">
Restore screen</a>.  Once a hold is completed, the percentage of secret rooms
found and conquered overall will be shown on the <a href="holdselect.html">Hold Select</a>
screen.  100% of rooms marked secret must be found and conquered in order for
the player to be able to pass through "<a href="editroom.html#masterwalls">Master walls</a>".</p>
<p><a name="editroom">Click</a> the "<b>E</b>dit Room" button or click on the mini-room image to
begin <a href="editroom.html">editing the selected room</a>.</p>
<p><a name="reflect"><b>Reflecting the level</b></a> - Press &lt;F7&gt; to reflect the level
horizontally (about the vertical axis) and &lt;F8&gt; to reflect the level
vertically.  All rooms will likewise be reflected.  Hint: individual rooms
can also be reflected in the <a href="editroom.html">room editor</a> using these keys.</p>
