<h3><u>Hold Management Screen</u></h3>
The Hold Management screen is reached by choosing "Change <b>L</b>ocation" from the <a
 href="commands.html">Main Menu</a> or clicking "Manage" from
the <a href="editselect.html">Level Editor</a>. This screen shows a list of
all the loaded holds.  Select one to view the hold description and the current
player's progress in the hold.  Holds beaten by the current player are marked
with the <a name="secrets">percentage of hold secrets</a> found and conquered by
the player. Hold names are colored differently based on what DROD version they
were authored in. The following options are available:<br />
<p><b>Okay</b> - selects the highlighted hold for play.</p>
<p><b>Cancel</b> - returns to the previous screen, leaving the selected hold
unchanged.</p>
<p><a name="export"><b>Export</b></a> - saves the selected hold to disk. &nbsp;This option
is available for any holds you author in the <a href="editselect.html">Level Editor</a>.
It allows you to share your levels with other players by giving them the
file saved to disk and having them import it into their DROD installation.</p>
<p><a name="import"><b>Import</b></a> - loads a DROD hold data file from disk. &nbsp;This allows you
to load or recover exported holds or upgrade existing holds.  Note that when
a hold is upgraded to a newer version, room solutions might be changed,
or rooms or levels removed altogether, making existing saved games potentially
invalid.</p>
<p><a name="delete"><b>Delete Hold</b></a> - permanently
removes a hold from your DROD installation.&nbsp; This will remove
all players' saved games and demos for this hold as well, so make sure
you are serious about doing this.</p>
<p><a name="download"><b>Download</b></a> - CaravelNet subscribers with an Internet connection
may take advantage of our special system for acquiring and installing official
holds and published fan-made holds and hold upgrades directly from the
official web site.  Downloadable online holds not yet installed into your copy
of DROD will be listed in gray letters.  Select a gray hold text to view hold
stats and ratings.  Click "<b>D</b>ownload" to download and install the
selected hold.  <a name="updated">Holds</a> marked as "Updated!" may also be downloaded.
This will upgrade the currently installed version of the hold.</p>
<p><a name="filter"><b>Hold filter</b></a> - Scroll through the options in the
Hold Filter to select a subset of holds to display in the list by type.</p>
<p><a name="caravelnet"><b>CaravelNet</b></a> - CaravelNet subscribers may
rate holds to provide feedback to other players.  You may also sort the list
of CaravelNet holds in the display by scoring and other criteria.</p>
