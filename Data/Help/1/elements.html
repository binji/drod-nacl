<h3><u>Basic Game Elements</u></h3>

<p>This page covers all the elements you'll find in "Gunthro and the Epic Blunder", but many more elements are known to exist and can be 
seen in other holds, and you can use them yourself in the <a href="editselect.html">editor</a>. These are discussed under 
<a href="elements2.html">Advanced Game Elements</a></p>

<p><img src="images/beethro.jpg" />
<a name="beethro">In</a> <b>"Gunthro and the Epic Blunder"</b> you play <b>Gunthro</b>. &nbsp;He and his sword take up two squares.
&nbsp;Keeping the sword between Gunthro and the monsters is the key to
staying alive. &nbsp;For more information about movement, see <a
 href="keyboard.html">Keyboard Commands</a>. In other holds (including earlier DROD games), you may play as Gunthro's grandson, Beethro. 
His behaviour is, for the most part, identical.</p>

<p><img src="images/monsters.jpg" />
The <a name="monsters"><b>monsters</b></a> Gunthro destroys in a room will come back to life
when you reenter the room if all of them are not destroyed. &nbsp;You
will want to refer to the authoritative <a href="monster.html">Monster
Reference</a> for more information.</p>

<p><img src="images/walls.jpg" />
Like <a name="walls"><b>walls</b></a> in the real world, these are obstacles that prevent
movement.</p>

<p><img src="images/crwalls.jpg" />
<a name="crumbly"><b>Crumbly walls</b></a> are ready to fall apart but have to be looked for
as they blend in with solid walls.</p>

<p><img src="images/pits.jpg" />
<a name="pits"><b>Pits</b></a> and <a name="water"><b>water</b></a> are not particularly dangerous since Gunthro is too
experienced an explorer to accidentally fall into them, but be careful
of <a name="trapdoors1"><b>trapdoors</b></a> that can leave him shanghaied and monsters that
fly or swim. &nbsp;Trapdoors fall away to pit or water after being stepped upon once.</p>

<p><img src="images/raft.jpg" />
<a name="platform"><b>Rafts</b></a> can be used by Gunthro to cross water-covered areas.
Shallow water however, is too shallow for rafts to be used.
</p>

<p><img src="images/gdoors.jpg" />
<a name="roomcleargates"><b>Room clear gates</b></a> (or <a name="greendoors"><b>green doors</b></a>) are opened when all of the
monsters in a room are
defeated. &nbsp;Once a green door is opened, it will remain open when a
room is left.</p>

<p><img src="images/bdoors.jpg" />
<a name="levelcleargates"><b>Level clear gates</b></a> (or <a name="bluedoors"><b>blue doors</b></a>) are opened when all of the
monsters in the level are
defeated and all rooms are visited. &nbsp;There are some exceptions to
these rules which you may encounter. &nbsp;Once a blue door is opened,
it will remain open when a room is left.</p>

<p><img src="images/rdoors.jpg" />
<a name="trapdoorgates"><b>Trapdoor gates</b></a> (or <a name="reddoors"><b>red doors</b></a>) are opened when all of the
<a name="trapdoors2"><b>trapdoors</b></a> in a room have
collapsed. &nbsp;Unlike green and blue doors, red doors always close
again when a room is left.</p>

<p><img src="images/ydoors.jpg" />
<a name="yellowdoors"><b>Yellow doors</b></a> are opened and closed by
striking <a name="orbs"><b>orbs</b></a> with
Gunthro's sword. &nbsp;When an orb is hit, bolts of energy will shoot
from it opening, closing, or toggling one or more doors. Some orbs are
damaged and can only be used once. &nbsp;There
are some tricky puzzles that are based on these doors.
&nbsp;Unlike green and blue doors, yellow doors return to their
original state when a room is left.</p>

<p><img src="images/plates.jpg" />
Like orbs, <a name="pressureplates"><b>pressure plates</b></a> are used to affect
yellow doors. They are activated when something weighs them down.
Three kinds of plates exist: one-time plates are only activated the first time
they're depressed, multi-use plates are activated each time they're depressed,
and on-off plates are activated both when they are depressed and when they are released.</p>

<p><img src="images/sohorn.jpg" />
When Gunthro picks up a <a name="sohorn"><b>soldier horn</b></a> he calls one nearby soldier to the nearest entrance to help out.
Rasarun soldiers behave like stalwarts - they are sworded allies who can help kill monsters, but aren't entirely bright.
If there are no entrance squares with a direct path to the player, the soldier does not appear and the horn is used up.</p>

<p><img src="images/sqhorn.jpg" />
When Gunthro picks up a <a name="sqhorn"><b>squad horn</b></a> he calls one nearby squad member to the nearest entrance to help out.
Squad members behave like player clones - you can switch to control them using the Tab key, or by clicking on them with the mouse.
If there are no entrance squares with a direct path to the player, the squad member does not appear and the horn is used up.</p>

<p><img src="images/stairs.jpg" />
<a name="exitstairs"><b>Stairways</b></a> connect areas of dungeons together.
Most levels are completed by finding stairs leading to the next.</p>

<p><img src="images/mwalls.jpg" />
<a name="masterwalls"><b>Master walls</b></a> will fade after the hold has been
completed and all the secret rooms in the hold have been cleared.
When these conditions have been met, restore game to a room with master walls.
Gunthro can now walk through them.</p>

<p><img src="images/scroll.jpg" />
<a name="scrolls"><b>Scrolls</b></a> contain information that may or may not be useful.
&nbsp;Gunthro must step on the same square they are in to read them.</p>

<p><img src="images/forcearrow.jpg" />
<a name="forcearrows"><b>Force arrows</b></a> prevent movement in the opposite direction they
point. &nbsp;The north-pointing force arrow could be stepped onto from
all directions except northwest, north, and northeast. &nbsp;Once
Gunthro steps onto a north-pointing force arrow he can leave in all
directions except southwest, south, and southeast.</p>

<p><img src="images/bombfuse.jpg" />
<a name="bomb"><b>Bombs</b></a> can be activated by either Gunthro's sword or a 
burning <a name="fuse"><b>fuse</b></a>. &nbsp;When a bomb explodes, monsters within a 
range of 3 squares of the bomb will die. &nbsp;If another bomb is located within that 
range, it will explode as well. &nbsp;A fuse can be activated by walking away from a 
fuse endpoint, or by an explosion. They will not burn against the direction of force arrows.</p>

<p><img src="images/tunnel.jpg" />
<a name="tunnels"><b>Tunnels</b></a> allow Gunthro to quickly move
from one area of a room to another.  When Gunthro is standing on a tunnel
square and moves in the direction the tunnel faces, he will reappear on the
closest tunnel square in the same column/row of that direction.  Monsters won't
ever use tunnels, and they will only move onto a tunnel square if Gunthro is
standing on it, in which case, Gunthro dies as usual.</p>

<p><img src="images/checkpoint.jpg" />
You can step on <a name="checkpoints"><b>checkpoints</b></a> to
save game at that point in time in the room. &nbsp;Using checkpoints
can make difficult rooms easier to conquer. &nbsp;If Gunthro dies after
stepping on a checkpoint in the room, he will return to the last
checkpoint he stepped on instead of starting the room over. &nbsp;A
checkpoint may be used to re-save the game when stepped on any number of
times. &nbsp;Checkpoints can be turned on or off in the <a
 href="settings.html">player settings</a>.</p>

<p><img src="images/map.jpg" />
The <a name="map"><b>minimap</b></a> shows the rooms in Gunthro's immediate vicinity that
have been explored. &nbsp;If a room has any monsters remaining it will
be red (if clearing the room is required to open the level's blue door)
or magenta (not required).&nbsp; Once all of the monsters have been removed
from the current room it will turn green.&nbsp; When Gunthro has exited
a green room successfully it will turn white.&nbsp; Usually, all rooms
must be turned white for Gunthro to exit the level.</p>

<p><img src="images/clock.jpg" />
When Gunthro's <a name="clock"><b>threat clock</b></a> appears, it will help you anticipate
forthcoming dangerous phenomena, which usually occur every <b>thirty</b> turns.
Other special monster events happen on multiples of five or ten.</p>
