<h3><u>Hints &amp; Tips: The Wisdom of Gunthro Budkin</u></h3>
<p>
I write these words for those who would pursue the honorable profession of
dungeon exterminator.
</p><p>
When roaches approach in a line, assess the width of
their progression:<br />
If it is but one roach wide, advance with confidence.<br />
If it is two roaches wide, hold your ground.<br />
If it is three roaches wide, a retreat will be necessary.
</p><p>
A sword may be wielded against enemies in two ways.
&nbsp;You may prefer swinging or stepping, but mastery of both is
necessary.
</p><p>
A pair of roaches should be no match for a master swordsman, even if they flank him on either side.
&nbsp; Should they attack from the rear, advance and seek cover.
</p><p>
Only an efficient swordsman will prevail against the
roach queen. &nbsp;Move swiftly to the queen, paying as little
attention to her offspring as safety permits.
</p><p>
Fools forget that they can move in eight directions.
</p><p>
Orbs are entirely predictable and simple to
understand. &nbsp;I have never found an orb to contain complex instructions.
</p><p>
Fear not the most devilish hordes when you stand upon
the force arrows correctly.
</p><p>
Evil eyes would rather sleep, so let them.
</p><p>
The fleet-footed may move easily among a nest of
serpents. &nbsp;They cannot move in the same ways you can, and their
predatory eyes will not find you well if you do not stand in their view.
</p><p>
Some stairways lead to unexpected places.
