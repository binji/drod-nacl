<h3><u>Advanced Game Elements</u></h3>

<p>These elements are used in both official and user-made holds, and are all available to you in the <a href="editselect.html">editor</a>, but are not
used in <b>Gunthro and the Epic Blunder</b></p>

<p><img src="images/platform.jpg" />
<a name="platform">Floating <b>Platforms</b></a> can be used by Beethro/Gunthro to cross areas of pit.
</p>

<p><img src="images/bridge.jpg" />
<a name="bridge"><b>Bridges</b></a> must be anchored to a wall, floor, trapdoor, or similar object
to remain in place. If all its anchor points are removed, the bridge falls down into the depths, taking
everything it supported with it.</p>

<p><img src="images/bkdoors.jpg" />
<a name="tarstuffgates"><b>Tarstuff gates</b></a> (or <a name="blackdoors"><b>black doors</b></a>)
are opened when all of the <a name="tarstuff"><b>tarstuff</b></a> 
in a room has been removed. &nbsp;Like yellow and red doors, leaving a room will 
make black doors close again.</p>

<p><img src="images/sistergates.jpg" />
The <a name="sistergates"><b>sister gates</b></a> behave exactly like their
counterparts, except that they close when the corresponding event happens. This
can be very dangerous in the case of level and room clear gates, which remain
closed even after you leave the room.</p>

<p><img src="images/hottile.jpg" />
<a name="hottile"><b>Hot tiles</b></a> are dangerous to stand on. Anything, including you,
that can be hurt by a sword will die if it stands still on a
hot tile for one turn. The only exceptions to this are the various forms of
tarstuff, which are completely unharmed by the heat.</p>

<p><img src="images/oremites.jpg" />
<a name="oremites"><b>Oremites</b></a> are small creatures that feed on metal.
They are not dangerous by themselves, but Beethro must keep his sword sheathed
when walking around in an area covered with them.
</p>

<p><img src="images/briars.jpg" />
<a name="briar"><b>Briars</b></a> block your way, but are not otherwise dangerous. However,
a patch of briars connected to a <a name="briarroot"><b>briar root</b></a> will grow outwards
at a steady pace. Each time the briar grows, the newly created briar pieces must first mature;
they do so at a rate of one per turn for each root in the patch. When the patch is completely
mature, it grows one tile outwards. Standing in its way at this point is a very bad idea.</p>

<p><img src="images/mimic.jpg" />
The <a name="mimics"><b>mimics</b></a> are unleashed when Beethro drinks a <a name="mimicpotion"><b>mimic potion</b></a>.
&nbsp;After Beethro drinks the potion, all activity in the room stops
while you use the movement keys to find a place for a mimic. &nbsp;When
you've reached the desired location, press the wait key ("5") and a
mimic will appear. &nbsp;Mimics are copies of Beethro and they move
exactly as he does. &nbsp;Pushing the mimics against obstacles will
change their position relative to Beethro.</p>

<p><img src="images/invis.jpg" />
When Beethro drinks an <a name="invispotion"><b>invisibility potion</b></a>, he becomes
invisible to monsters. &nbsp;However, if he steps within 5 squares of a
monster it will be able to smell him.&nbsp; Picking up another
invisibility potion will make Beethro visible again.</p>

<p><img src="images/decoy.jpg" />
<a name="decoys"><b>Decoys</b></a> are produced when Beethro drinks a
<a name="decoypotion"><b>decoy potion</b></a>. &nbsp;Like
mimic potions, after drinking, all activity stops until the decoy has been 
placed. &nbsp;Decoys will not move after it has been placed. &nbsp;They can be 
used to distract monsters. &nbsp;If a decoy is within 5 squares of a monster and 
Beethro is far away, the monster will move to the decoy instead of Beethro.</p>

<p><img src="images/clone.jpg" />
<a name="clones"><b>Clones</b></a> are produced when Beethro drinks a
<a name="clonepotion"><b>clone potion</b></a>. When left alone, clones don't do much of
anything, but Beethro is able to move his consciousness from his current body to a
clone (using the "Tab" key), thus allowing him to reach areas that would not otherwise be
accessible.</p>

<p><img src="images/speed.jpg" />
<a name="speedpotion"><b>Speed potions</b></a> make Beethro faster, allowing him
to make two moves in the time he normally makes one.</p>

<p><img src="images/mirror.jpg" />
<a name="mirrors"><b>Mirrors</b></a> not only block Evil Eye and Aumtlich gazes,
and can be used to weigh down pressure plates.
Beethro can push them around by himself, or he can use his sword to do so.
He can destroy them by striking them head-on. They can also be pushed into shallow water to make stepping stones, but sink in deep water.</p>

<p><img src="images/arrowrotators.jpg" />
When Beethro steps on an <a name="arrowrotator"><b>arrow rotator token</b></a>,
all force arrows in the room are turned 45 degrees in the direction indicated.
The token then changes direction, and stepping on it again will rotate arrows back.</p>

<p><img src="images/tarswitcher.jpg" />
When Beethro steps on a <a name="tarstuffswitcher"><b>tar/mud switcher</b></a>,
all tar in the room changes to mud, and vice-versa. Other versions also exist.</p>

<p><img src="images/visiontoken.jpg" />
Stepping on a <a name="visiontoken"><b>vision token</b></a> gives Beethro
enhanced awareness of his surroundings. This allows him to see invisible things,
what is hidden under tarstuff, and makes him aware of the line of sight of evil eyes.
Stepping on the token again removes this effect.</p>

<p><img src="images/powertoken.jpg" />
Stepping on a <a name="powertoken"><b>power token</b></a> allows Beethro to control
any fegundos in the room and activate orbs by touching them.
It also alerts all monsters in the room that whoever just activated the token
is edible.
This doesn't matter much to Beethro, whom the monsters try to eat
anyway, but it may matter to other individuals.</p>

<p><img src="images/disarmtoken.jpg" />
When Beethro steps on a <a name="disarmtoken"><b>disarm token</b></a>, his sword is taken
away. The upside of this is that while he's swordless, he can walk on trapdoors without
dropping them. He can get his sword back by stepping on the token again or leaving the room.</p>

<p><img src="images/station.jpg" />
The <a name="relaystation"><b>relay station</b></a> is a place where the Empire's citizens
work. Citizens will continually move between relay stations to pick up materials.</p>

<p><img src="images/persistentmovement.jpg" />
The <a name="movementtoken"><b>persistent movement token</b></a> is always
activated. When this token is present in a room, citizens will never give
up in their attempts to reach the next relay station on their route.</p>

<p><img src="images/ortho.jpg" />
<a name="orthosquares"><b>Orthogonal squares</b></a> prevent all movements of diagonal 
directions. &nbsp;This means that if Beethro is standing on such a square, he can only 
leave this square by north, east, south or west. &nbsp;It also means that he cannot 
enter an orthogonal square diagonally.</p>

<p><img src="images/conquertoken.jpg" />
If a <a name="conquertoken"><b>conquer token</b></a> is present in a room,
you must step on it to conquer the room. Additionally, your CaravelNet
high score for conquering the room is calculated as the number of moves it
took you to reach the token, rather than the number of moves it took you to
clear the room and leave.</p>
