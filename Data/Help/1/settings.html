<h3><u>Changing Settings</u></h3>
<p>The Settings Screen can be reached from the <a href="commands.html">Main
Menu</a> by choosing the "Change <b>S</b>ettings" option. &nbsp;The following settings
are available: </p>
<p><a name="personal"><b>Personal</b></a> - Enter your player name and optional
 <a href="caravelNet.html">CaravelNet</a> information here.</p>
<p><a name="graphics"><b>Graphics</b></a> - Click "Use <a name="fullscreen">full screen</a>" to toggle between
full screen and windowed mode (1024x768). &nbsp;Note that you can also
use the F10 key to do this at any time. &nbsp;Turning off <a name="alpha">"Alpha blending"</a> can
reduce slowdown for certain in-game effects if you're experiencing a low
framerate.  However, it will also disable all those nice fade effects.</p>
<p><a name="sound"><b>Sound</b></a> - You may turn sound effects, game <a name="speech">speech</a> and background <a name="music">music</a>
on or off and set the volume each is played at. Unclick "Show <a name="subtitles">subtitles</a> when voices play"
if you do not want subtitle text to be displayed in the game while characters
are talking.  If sound effects or music
doesn't work, first try closing other applications and restarting DROD.
If you are still without sound, try rebooting your computer.</p>
<p><a name="special"><b>Special</b></a> - Select whether to play with room checkpoints or not,
and whether to save <a href="demos.html">demos</a> at special points in
the game. Checkpoints allow saving at certain locations in the middle
of some rooms.</p>
<p><b><a href="keyboard.html" name="keyboard">Keyboard commands</a></b> - Use to
redefine the game commands to different keys. &nbsp;If you are using a
non-US keyboard or have selected a layout other than Qwerty (i.e.
Dvorak), you may see incorrect key descriptions as you redefine keys.
&nbsp;Despite this, the key redefinitions will probably work once you
begin playing the game. &nbsp;(Sorry. &nbsp;We would like to fix this
problem in a future release.)</p>
<p><a name="repeatrate">Repeat Rate</a> - Controls keyboard repeat rate (i.e. movement rate) during play.
&nbsp;Increasing it will decrease the delay between moves when a key is
held down.  Decreasing it will make movement animations smoother.</p>
<p><a name="editor"><b>Editor</b></a> - When "Save
automatically" is checked, changes you make to a room in the <a
 href="editroom.html">editor</a> are saved on leaving the room.
&nbsp;Turn this option off if you want to be prompted before saving any
room changes. &nbsp;Check "Show item tips" to receive help placing
special objects in the room. </p>
